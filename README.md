# DayZ-Backup-Batch

A batch file that will backup your DayZ SA server. 

## Directions
- Fill in the "dayzserverfolder", "dayzbackuppath", "profilename", and "instanceId"
- Set the number of days you want to keep backups using the "backupAge" setting
- "deloriglogs" will clean up your profile folder of old logs
- "deldynamicdbs" will refresh your loot

NOTE - This is recommended to be run while the server is NOT running. So time it with your restarts. (It should work fine while it is running, but just be warned)
